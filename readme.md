# Enterprise Note

The application you will build is called Enterprise Note and offers the notion of a shared notebook. 
The idea is that notes can be shared with identified users who can write and read notes in this notebook.
You will pay special attention to a search and filter function that enables users to sift through unstructured texts. 
Security is an important feature as only authorized users on this notebook will have access. 
The application will be available as a web-service with a light-weight front-end (you're not required to build a GUI front-end).
